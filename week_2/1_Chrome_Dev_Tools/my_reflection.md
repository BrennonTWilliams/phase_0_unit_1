# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


The Document Object Model is a framework (actually an "application programming interface") that allows different files (HTML, CSS, XML, etc) to interact with one another to dynamically update the style, structure and content of a webpage. I understand why its needed and the benefit it provides. I've read about the DOM being represented as a tree, I'm a little shaky on this metaphor. I can't really think of any negatives to the DOM, it's important to standardize the way web information is structured.

My site is way, way, way simpler than the Wordpress site I compared to (http://www.biritemarket.com/). Each one of my panels is sparsely populated, while every one of the Bi-Rite panes are filled with code and files. I suppose that says a lot about the complexity of a seemingly-simple website, as well has how far we have to go.

I think Chrome Web Tools will be awesome for analysis and tweaking sites. However, I wouldn't want to use it instead of an IDE. There's a lot of clutter and nothing beats the simplicity of Sublime.

My biggest "aha!" moment was actually in reading about the DOM. I never thought to think about how important it is to standardize the way web pages are built.
