      <h3>Terms of Pair Programming</h3>
      <h4>Paired Programming</h4>
      <p>Two programmers collaborating on the same project, with one "driving" 
      and the other "navigating".</p>
      <h4>Driver</h4>
      <p>The person who is writing the code.</p>
      <h4>Navigator</h4>
      <p>The person who directs the code-writing. 
      Basically, the navigator tells the driver what to write.</p>
      
      <h3>Paired Programming for GPS 1.1</h3>
      <p>Each student can fill in the knowledge gaps of the other. 
      A quick introduction to the process and dynamic of paired programming.</p>
      
      <h3>Paired Programming for DBC</h3>
      <p>Preparing for real world collaboration through multiple opportunities
        to use the skills.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Real world Paired Programming</h3>
      <p>Applying the skills we've developed to collaborate on live projects.
        Increasing our abilities to function well within the context of team programming.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Brennon reflection: It was fun! It was a weird dynamic at first, but 
      over time I came to see how valuable it was and how useful it will be in a 
        professional setting. I enjoyed it and it took a little bit more time...
        I think the driver-nagivator relationship works really well, and I'm pretty
        proud of what we've done, so I don't think anything didn't work.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ariel's reflection: It was a little bit challenging at the very beginning to
        negotioate the roles and get a sense of how each person works. But I really
        enjoyed pairing with Brennon, and I felt as though as time went on there was
        definitely a very strong team dynamic that helped speed up the process where
        it might have taken me way longer to make trivial decisions. I though that
        dealing with the different roles did work. What didn't work was figuring out
        what would work within the style tag and what wouldn't. But, overall I look
        forward to many future opportunities to pair with others. Honestly, this was
        way less painful than I anticipated it would be.
