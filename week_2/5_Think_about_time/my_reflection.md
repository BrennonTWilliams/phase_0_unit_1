# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 is managing all my coursework as well as my social life (hopefully). I'm trying to get two degrees in different fields in four years, which is tough. I have to make lots of sacrifices to get everything done. In fact I write this on Spring Break, as my friends romp around on a Florida beach one hundred paces from our hotel (but the view from the room is nice...).

I'm a practicioner of ruthless efficiency. I binge-work, sitting down and tackling a project, problem or assignment until it is done. Sometimes this will take upwards of six to nine hours, which can be strenuous if sessions are done consecutively, but boy can you get a lot of work done.

I generally have trouble sleeping. If I have a decent amout of work to do the next day, I'll set up a clock by my bed. If I can't fall asleep within 30 minutes I get up and start on the next day's work, compensating with a nap later.

I really enjoyed reading the articles on meditation. For my Honors Biology Final Research Paper in high school I looked at 3D brain imaging of meditation participants. After completing the paper and seeing first-hand how much meditation can do, I started to put in a few minutes a day. It helps me stay focused throughout the day, and has a noticeable impact on my life.

My "overall plan" is to basically do what I've always done: work long and smart hours, balance work with excercise and social outings, and enjoy the sense of accomplishment I get when I finish an assignment.
